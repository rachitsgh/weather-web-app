# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates

## Objective

Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/).

## Data Source

The system will continuously retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You will need to sign up for a free API key to access the data. The API provides various weather parameters, and for this assignment, we will focus on:

- **main**: Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
- **temp**: Current temperature in Centigrade
- **feels_like**: Perceived temperature in Centigrade
- **dt**: Time of the data update (Unix timestamp)

## Processing and Analysis

The system should continuously call the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for the metros in India: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad.

For each received weather update:
- Convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit based on user preference).
- The system will continuously retrieve weather data, process it, and store the daily summaries in the specified database. Alerts will be triggered if the configured thresholds are breached.


## Rollups and Aggregates

### 1. Daily Weather Summary

- **Roll up the weather data for each day.**
- **Calculate daily aggregates for:**
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition (based on the most frequent condition throughout the day)
- **Store the daily summaries in a database or persistent storage for further analysis.**

### 2. Alerting Thresholds

- **Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature or specific weather conditions (e.g., alert if temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius for two consecutive updates).**
- **Continuously track the latest weather data and compare it with the thresholds.**
- **If a threshold is breached, trigger an alert for the current weather conditions. Alerts could be displayed on the console or sent through an email notification system (implementation details left open-ended).**

### 3. Implement Visualizations

- **To display daily weather summaries, historical trends, and triggered alerts.**

## Test Cases

### 1. System Setup

- Verify system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.

### 2. Data Retrieval

- Simulate API calls at configurable intervals.
- Ensure the system retrieves weather data for the specified locations and parses the response correctly.

### 3. Temperature Conversion

- Test conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit) based on user preference.

### 4. Daily Weather Summary

- Simulate a sequence of weather updates for several days.
- Verify that daily summaries are calculated correctly, including average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather condition.

### 5. Alerting Thresholds

- Define and configure user thresholds for temperature or weather conditions.
- Simulate weather data exceeding or breaching the thresholds.
- Verify that alerts are triggered only when a threshold is violated.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ReactJs
- OpenWeatherMap API key


### Installation
